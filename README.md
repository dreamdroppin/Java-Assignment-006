# Spelling Test - Java Assignment 6

**Instructions:**
1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch named `Feature01`.

## Assignment

**Preamble:**
* In the game of Scrabble, each player possesses a set of tiles with letters on them. The objective is to use these letters to form words, and the scoring system is based on the complexity of the words. Longer words generally yield higher scores. Imagine you have your set of tiles represented as a string, such as "quijibo," and you are provided with another string to test, like "jib."

**Objective:**
* Write a method named `canSpell` that takes two strings as parameters and checks whether the set of tiles can be used to spell the given word. Note that you may have more than one tile with the same letter, but each tile can be used only once.

**Code:**
1. In the file [CanSpell.java](src/CanSpell.java), implement the `canSpell` method in the provided Java code.
2. Test your implementation with different sets of tiles and words.

## Submission
Follow these steps for submission:
1. Create a Feature01 branch of your code if you haven't already.
